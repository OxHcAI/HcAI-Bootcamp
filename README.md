## Human-centred AI Design Bootcamp

A 5-day Human-centred AI (HcAI) Design Bootcamp where participants can train to identify, design, and prototype digital health solutions for complex healthcare challenges using AI tools.

## Let's build Medical AI together!

Digital Health and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are integral parts of the future of health and care. There are multiple areas where in the broader medical domain AI has the potential to impact at a systems level as well as to help individuals. A combined approach to developing AI with considering healthcare systems is when related technologies are used to facilitate evidence-based support for clinical decision-making, automate of healthcare systems tasks, and foster patient-physician interactions. We describe this as **Medical AI**.

When developing Medical AI, a strong focus should be **designing before deploying**, as many of the current efforts are fragmented and face challenges when implementing AI in real-world settings.
This is also why adoption of AI in design and delivery of healthcare modalities has not been as easily welcomed as in areas like finance, consumer technology, and manufacturing. Slow adoption of AI-informed tools and treatments can be mainly attributed to three factors:

1. concerns around safety and trustworthiness of AI Health;
2. uncertainty regarding accountability when patients are at risk/harm;
3. exacerbation of health inequalities and digital biases due to lack of patient and public involvement and engagement in the development of digital health solutions.

**Human-Centred Medical AI Design** is a design innovation approach that develops evidence-based solutions informed by diverse stakeholders to achieve holistic outcomes in the context of large complex health and care systems.

This **bootcamp** is intended to engage key stakeholders by introducing them to theories and practices so that they can understand the characteristics and mechanisms of developing Medical AI by working with Digital Health Designers. At the end of the bootcamp, each team should be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to further **co-create and co-design** Medical AI solutions within their communities and beyond. During this bootcamp, each team will also engage in identifying patient needs and develop solutions in an iterative design process, by creating contextual prototypes that can be implemented in real-world settings.
